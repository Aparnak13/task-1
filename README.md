# task-1
To clean the dataset, I began by examining the structure of the Excel file and identified that it contained two unnecessary columns labeled Unnamed: 0 and Unnamed: 1, which were completely empty. These columns were removed to eliminate clutter. Next, I focused on the main column containing date and time information, originally named Scheduled_ Day. I renamed it to Scheduled_DateTime for clarity and consistency. Finally, I standardized the values in this column by converting them into a uniform date-month-year format and removed any associated timezone information to ensure uniformity across all entries. The cleaned dataset was then saved as a new Excel file for further use or analysis
